# WebexCC Realtime Route Info - wxcc-rt-routeinfo
Sample project to demonstrate sharing WebexCC Queue and Team real-time & summary stats via REST API. The solution primarily aims to enable on-premise CCX/CCE clients to make intelligent routing decisions based on the current state of WebexCC to facilitate a smooth and incremental transition to the cloud platform.

### Environment Setup
Ensure the project build environment is configured with the required libraries and tools listed below.

* [Java SDK17 or later](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html)
* [Gradle Build Tool](https://gradle.org/releases/)

### Project Setup

* Create a new [WxCC App](https://developer.webex-cx.com/my-apps) to generate the Client ID & Secret with the foolwing settings
  * Scopes: cjp:config, cjp:config_write, cjp:config_read, spark:people_read, cjp:user
  * Redirect URL: [Service Base URL]/login/oauth2/code/wxccrouter
* Clone or download and extract the project to a local directory
* Update the project /src/main/resources/application.yaml with the Client ID, Secret, and Redirect URL
* Follow Gradle documentation to build and run the service executable JAR

IMPORTANT: The service URL must be SSL-enabled (HTTPS) to be accepted for event notification webhook URL.
